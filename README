EMACS setup

I re-used lots of ideas from the following emacs project
https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs

* Emacs plug-ins

Extra packages are installed with el-get

* Extra dependencies:
el-get needs bzr to checkout python-mode. Some plug-ins need tex to compile.

apt-get install texinfo
apt-get install texlive
apt-get install bzr
apt-get install git

Distel mode depends on Erlang mode, so need to correct a path to the version of 
tools/emacs (why erlang install doesn't make symlink to it?)

;; load a path to elang list as distel install in el-get distel package depends on it
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/tools-2.6.13/emacs")
