* EMACS setup

I re-used lots of ideas from the following emacs project
https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs

* Environment vars 

** ERL_TOP
The path to erlang installation are loaded from env var ERL_TOP so
this var needs to be set in bash .profile

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# root of erlang install
export ERL_TOP=/usr/local/lib/erlang
#+END_SRC

** PYTHONPATH

PYTHONPATH is used by python-mode, should be setup by .profile

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:
#+END_SRC

If this env is not setup, erlang-path-settings will set the default
location '/usr/local/lib/erlang'

* Emacs plug-ins

Extra packages are installed with el-get

* Extra dependencies:

el-get needs bzr to checkout python-mode. Some plug-ins need tex to compile.

these packages needs to be installed before running el-get install
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt-get install texinfo
apt-get install texlive
apt-get install bzr
apt-get install git
#+END_SRC

* Distel-mode

Distel mode depends on Erlang mode, so need to correct a path to the version of 
tools/emacs (why erlang install doesn't make symlink to it?)

need to add this line in init.el
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; load a path to erlang list as distel install in el-get distel package depends on it
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/tools-2.6.14/emacs")
#+END_SRC

* Syntax checker for erlang-mode
I am using [[https://github.com/ten0s/syntaxerl][syntaxerl]], which integrates with flymake

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git://github.com/ten0s/syntaxerl.git
cd syntaxerl
make
#+END_SRC 

this will generate syntaxerl file which needs to be added to .emacs.d/bin
